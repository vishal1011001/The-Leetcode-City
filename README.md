## What is LeetCode City?

LeetCode City transforms every LeetCode profile into a unique pixel art building. The more you solve, the taller your building grows. Explore an interactive 3D city, fly between buildings, and discover developers from around the world.

## Features

- **3D Pixel Art Buildings** — Each LeetCode user becomes a building with height based on submissions, width based on skill levels, and lit windows representing activity
- **Free Flight Mode** — Fly through the city with smooth camera controls, visit any building, and explore the skyline
- **Profile Pages** — Dedicated pages for each developer with stats, achievements, and top solved problems
- **Achievement System** — Unlock achievements based on submissions, points, and more
- **Building Customization** — Claim your building and customize it with items from the shop (crowns, auras, roof effects, face decorations)
- **Social Features** — Send kudos, gift items to other developers, refer friends, and see a live activity feed
- **Compare Mode** — Put two developers side by side and compare their buildings and stats
- **Share Cards** — Download shareable image cards of your profile in landscape or stories format

## How Buildings Work

| Metric         | Affects           | Example                                |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Submissions    | Building height   | 1,000 solved → taller building         |
| Active Days    | Building width    | More active days → wider base          |
| Points         | Window brightness | More points → more lit windows         |
| Recent Activity| Window pattern    | Recent solve → distinct glow pattern   |

Buildings are rendered with instanced meshes and a LOD (Level of Detail) system for performance. Close buildings show full detail with animated windows; distant buildings use simplified geometry.
