On return visits, assets are re-downloaded or re-evaluated, making the initial loading bar take several seconds even when the browser cache is enabled.\n\n### Expected Behavior\nAsset loading should be optimized via parallelization, asset pre-fetching, and secure caching so that returning visitors experience an instantaneous transition.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n1. Use \`<link rel="prefetch">\` or Next.js dynamic imports to start loading heavy chunks (like Three.js libraries and landmark models) in the background.\n2. Configure explicit HTTP cache-control headers on static 3D models (\`.glb\`) and audio files.\n3. Add a Service Worker cache strategy (e.g. Cache First) specifically optimized for game assets.`,

Although instanced meshes are used for basic building blocks, rendering detailed features (like custom colored window frames, outlines, and lighting updates) for buildings far from the camera creates a massive vertex processing load, dropping the framerate below 30 FPS on low-end or mobile devices.\n\n### Expected Behavior\nThe scene should run smoothly at 60 FPS on all modern devices by reducing geometry complexity for distant objects.\n\n### Proposed Solution\nImplement a Level of Detail (LOD) rendering system:\n1. For buildings close to the camera, render detailed instanced blocks, windows, and light updates.\n2. For buildings far away (e.g. distance > 1000 units), swap the geometry with simplified low-poly single-box meshes and disable local window/lighting calculations.\n3. Implement simple frustum-based viewport culling to avoid updating or rendering blocks entirely out of bounds.`,

When this happens, the page goes entirely black or white and remains unresponsive until the user performs a hard refresh.\n\n### Expected Behavior\nThe system should handle WebGL crashes gracefully and recover the scene structure automatically without user intervention.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n1. Add listener handlers for \`webglcontextlost\` and \`webglcontextrestored\` events on the canvas render target.\n2. Upon context loss, pause the render loop, save the current camera coordinates, and clean up active references.\n3. Upon context restoration, re-initialize the Three.js WebGLRenderer, re-load the models/textures, and resume the frame updates.`,
